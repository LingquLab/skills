# Code Review

## Skills Under Test

- `superpowers-neo-requesting-code-review`
- `superpowers-neo-receiving-code-review`

## Request

A cross-module public API change has an approved spec and passing focused tests. External review returns four comments:

1. A valid finding identifies an unchecked error path with a concrete file and reproduction.
2. An ambiguous comment says only that compatibility is wrong without naming the supported version or behavior.
3. An incorrect comment claims a documented thread-safe API is unsafe, contradicting the linked platform contract and tests.
4. A scope-expanding comment asks for an unrelated cache layer because it would be more professional.

## Expected Behavior

- Request independent review because the change is broad and affects a public interface.
- Give the reviewer the spec, relevant plan, diff, and test results without an expected conclusion.
- Report findings by severity with locations and technical consequences.
- Implement and verify the valid error-path finding.
- Ask for the missing compatibility boundary before acting on the ambiguous comment.
- Reject the incorrect safety claim with the authoritative contract and current evidence.
- Reject or escalate the unrelated cache request as a scope change rather than silently adding it.

## Failure Signals

- Requiring fixed double review for every small task.
- Accepting feedback because of reviewer authority alone.
- Adding unrelated scope without user approval.
- Reporting no findings without mentioning test gaps or residual risk.
- Treating all four comments identically instead of evaluating their technical status.

## Request B: No-Spec Security Review

A small authentication change has a settled user request and explicit acceptance criteria but no design spec or persistent plan. The diff is narrow, but a mistake could expose credentials.

## Expected Behavior B

- Request independent review because security impact justifies it despite the small diff.
- Use the settled request and acceptance criteria as the scope authority rather than searching for or fabricating a spec or plan.
- Provide the actual diff and fresh security-relevant verification, including any unavailable checks or gaps.

## Failure Signals B

- Skipping review solely because the diff is small.
- Blocking review until a spec or plan is manufactured.
- Reviewing against assumptions not present in the settled request or acceptance criteria.
